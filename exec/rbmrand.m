% This program trains Restricted Boltzmann Machine in which
% visible, binary, stochastic pixels are connected to
% hidden, binary, stochastic feature detectors using symmetrically
% weighted connections. Learning is done with 1-step Contrastive Divergence.   
% The program assumes that the following variables are set externally:
% maxepoch  -- maximum number of epochs
% numhid    -- number of hidden units 
% batchdata -- the data that is divided into batches (numcases numdims numbatches)
% restart   -- set to 1 if learning starts from beginning 





[numcases numdims numbatches]=size(batchdata);

if restart ==1,
  restart=0;
  epoch=1;

% Initializing symmetric weights and biases. 
  vishid     = 0.03*randn(numdims, numhid);
  hidbiases  = 0.03*randn(1,numhid);
  visbiases  = 0.03*randn(1,numdims);
  
  poshidprobs = zeros(numcases,numhid);
  neghidprobs = zeros(numcases,numhid);
